# Regenerate the Flatpak cargo-sources.json from Cargo.lock and copy it to the
# Flathub manifest, so both offline-vendoring manifests match the lockfile.
#
# Why this exists: the regenerate-then-copy pair was a two-line snippet
# duplicated in `scripts/release.sh`'s failure message, `release-version.md`
# step 8, and `packaging/AGENTS.md`. Every copy is a chance to bump one manifest
# and forget the other — the exact drift `packaging/AGENTS.md` warns about, and
# the exact gate `release.sh` section 11b fails a release on. `cargo update`
# during release preparation invalidates both files, and nothing bridged that
# step to this one, so the first `release.sh --dry-run` after a dependency bump
# reliably failed on a stale cargo-sources.json. Run this straight after
# `cargo update` / `cargo generate-lockfile` and the gate stays green.
#
# It does NOT do git. No add, no commit — same contract as bump-version.sh. The
# merge/tag/push is scripts/release.sh, run by the maintainer.
#
# Needs python3 and network (the generator fetches per-crate checksums). On a
# box without either — a macOS release host, say — this cannot run, which is why
# `release.sh`'s check degrades to a warning there rather than a hard failure;
# regenerate on Linux before handing the release over.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/sync-cargo-sources.sh            regenerate + copy
#   scripts/sync-cargo-sources.sh --check    verify both match Cargo.lock without
#                                            writing (exit 1 if stale)
